## Installation

1. Download the latest release of the plugin
2. Drop the `yml2twig` plugin folder to `craft/plugins`
3. Create a file `yml2twig.yml` at the root of your craft templates folder
4. Install Yml2twig plugin from the control panel in `Settings > Plugins`
5. Inside your twig template, you can load your YAML content like this : `{% set var = craft.yml2twig.content %}`
